β.5.4: circumflex in <muskouantamwâheoog> somewhat conjectural
α, β.5.8: apparent <pehketeahoncheg> in both manuscript (more clearly in β; α may have a smudged <o>), but <o> is expected etymologically

β.13.21: <ahtôou> or <ahtòou>?
α.13.24: macron in <ogqueneūkqussu> looks more like an inverted breve, but <u> is unusually large; a macron seems very likely but not certain
β.13.25: check a third manuscript for acute of <kaéhettit>
13.30: Note <yó/yô pajeh> in both editions for 'until'; <nô/nó pajeh> would be expected. A Moheganism?

α.13.33: possible acute over <a> of <tatupiñeonkqussuonk>

β.14.6: <pomugkóoh> may be <pomugkôoh> (but unlikely)--but Higgins has <pomug[kô]oh>--check another edition. Circumflex in <8sekêteaheuh> also missing from Higgins. β.14.6 may also (but probably doesn't) end in a comma rather than a period

β.14.11: possible diacritic over second <a> of <paudtauun>?
α.14.15: text has <wutttinnóuh>, with three <t>'s, for emended <wuttinnóuh>. Similarly with <attóónat> (text: <atttóónat>)

17.27: which of <woshwunnuman> (α) or <woshwunnumau> (β) is correct?
β.18.1: possible acute on <e> of <Jesusoh>; possible diacritic (circumflex?) over <a> of <n8waog>
β.18.2: possible grave/circumflex over second <u> of <wunnashaumꝏ̄óont>
α.18.15: <a> of <nôaush> extremely faint. Perhaps this is <nô ush>?

α.18.34: some sort of diacritic over the third <a> of <sasamâkuhhuwaenuog>, but I cannot tell which; shape of letter seems most consistent with a circumflex or perhaps a grave. Circumflex in <nô> may be an acute, but is probably not.
α.20.1: text has <sohbog> for <sohhog>
α.20.28: first/second-to-last <o> of <8tinneumunneaôont> has some sort of diacritic per its shape, but cannot be pinned down with certainty. A circumflex seems plausible
α.21.2: first <a> of <otanamesit> extremely faint
α.21.7: acute in <quenoshóneau> may be a circumflex
α.21.8: text has <may nt> for first token of <may ut>. Possible diacritic (grave?) over <a> of <onkatogig>, but likely just heavy ink
α.21.12: first <e> of <kepuhteau> is extremely faint/missing in text
α.21.15: narrow space between <temple> and <ut> in <templeut>; difficult to tell whether this was intended as a word-space
α.21.30: first word appears to be <Koh> in text

α.22.29: apparent <Panue> for <Panne> in text
α.23.4: acute in <wussauunukqunáoash> may be spurious
