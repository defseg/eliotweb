β.1.6: <a> of <kukqush8ongan8ôut> very faint but presumed; circumflex of final <ô> needs another witness
β.1.8: final <nt> of <kumehcheéunnaónt> may be a <ut> (emend to <ut>?)
β.1.11: <nul Lordumun> may be <nul-Lordumun>
β.1.12: <ê> of <sasêgenamwe> seems to have a circumflex, but needs a second copy
β.1.15: acute of <kummehquontamunnaóut> may be a circumflex
β.1.18: <wów8uk> in text for emended <wóm8uk>
α.2.13: circumflex in <wekontamwáheâog> may be hallucinated
β.2.16: possible accent (grave?) over second <e> of <ummàtcheseonk>
β.2.21: <a> of <watche> probably correct reading (even if typo) but check a second copy
β.3.9: acute on final <o> <wutawakompunónat> may be something else
α.3.16: diacritic on final <o> of <uppaguanuonganuòut> is very unclear; a grave is presumed but a circumflex is plausible. Similarly with the same vowel of the same word in β.3.16
